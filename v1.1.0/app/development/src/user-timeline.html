                The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron masterpiece located in Paris, France. It was
                designed by Gustave Eiffel and was completed in 1889 as the entrance arch for the
                1889 World's Fair. The tower stands at a height of 324 meters (1,063 feet) and was
                the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler
                Building in New York City. The Eiffel Tower offers breathtaking panoramic views of
                the city and is one of the most iconic landmarks globally, attracting millions of
                visitors each year.

                    Tower truly is a marvel of engineering and a symbol of Parisian elegance. I had the
